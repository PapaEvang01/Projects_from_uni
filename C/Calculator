🧮 Terminal Calculator in C
This is a powerful, single-file calculator written in C that supports full mathematical expression parsing. It reads input from the user, parses it using the Shunting Yard algorithm, and evaluates the result with proper operator precedence and parentheses.

✨ Features
Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, ^

Full expression parsing: e.g. (3 + 2) * 5 - 1 / 2

Parentheses and precedence: Proper math order of operations

Unary functions:

sqrt, abs, log, ln, exp, fact, sin, cos, tan

Special keyword: Ans refers to the last result

Interactive terminal interface

Commands:

q: quit

c: clear screen (Windows)

🧠 How It Works
The calculator uses a three-step process:

Tokenization – The input string is broken into tokens such as numbers, operators, functions, and parentheses.

Shunting Yard Algorithm – The infix expression is converted into postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation), which respects precedence and associativity.

Evaluation – The postfix expression is evaluated using a stack.

🛠️ Build and Run
Make sure you have a C compiler like gcc, then run:

gcc -o calculator calculator.c -lm
./calculator
