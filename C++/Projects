🎓 C++ Projects from My Uni Days

These two projects were built during my second semester at university — one of my first real encounters with C++.
I wanted to challenge myself with both logic-based AI and real-time image processing, and these small but fun projects helped me grow a lot as a developer.

🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe (with AI)
A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game written in clean C++. You can play against the computer with three difficulty levels:

Easy: random moves

Medium: blocks your winning moves

Hard: uses the Minimax algorithm to play perfectly (unbeatable!)

You can choose to play first or second, and input moves like A1, C2, etc.
It was my first time implementing a full AI logic tree — and it really helped me understand how decision-making works in code.

🤳 SmartSelfie (with OpenCV)
This one’s more visual: a webcam-based app that captures a selfie and applies face detection + image filters using OpenCV.

Detects faces using a Haar Cascade and draws rectangles

Saves three versions:

the original photo

a face-detected version

a grayscale + blurred version

It was my first real dive into computer vision, and it showed me how powerful C++ can be when paired with libraries like OpenCV.

Together, these two projects reflect a nice balance between algorithmic thinking and practical coding.
Tic-Tac-Toe taught me about game logic and AI decision-making, while SmartSelfie opened the door to real-time image processing and working with hardware (like the webcam).

🛠️ Both projects were developed in Visual Studio on Windows.

They marked a turning point — when C++ finally started to make sense, and coding became something I genuinely loved doing.
