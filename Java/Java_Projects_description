ðŸŽ“ Java Projects from My Early University Days

In my early years of university, I had the opportunity to explore Java programming through two hands-on projects â€”
one focused on graph theory and the other on real-time networking.
These projects helped me build a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and socket programming.

ðŸ“Š Graph Algorithms & Visualization

This project demonstrates core graph concepts using Java and Graphviz. It generates a random weighted graph and applies key algorithms like:

BFS & DFS for traversal

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for shortest paths

Primâ€™s Algorithm for minimum spanning tree

The entire graph and results are visualized in PNG images using DOT/Graphviz. This was a great introduction to both Java collections and visual debugging of algorithms.

ðŸ’¬ Java Socket Group Chat App

A command-line group chat system using TCP sockets. Users can register or log in and chat in real time. Features include:

Multi-client communication via threads

Simple file-based user login (users.txt)

Timestamps, welcome messages, and graceful exits

Built using Eclipse, it gave me solid practice in Java networking and thread synchronization â€” and it was surprisingly fun to see live communication working from the console.
