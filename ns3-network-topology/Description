🔌 Project 1: P2P with CSMA – Intro to Network Topology
Simulates a hybrid network with:

A point-to-point link (n0 ↔ n1)

A CSMA LAN with 20+ nodes connected via n1

A UDP Echo Server on n0, client on n21

🎯 Goal: Understand how different link types (P2P + Ethernet) interact.

📡 Project 2: TCP Simulation – DropTail vs RED Queuing
Simulates a 4-node TCP network:

Bulk TCP flows from A & B to D, through router C

Compares DropTail (default) vs RED (Active Queue Management)

📁 Files:

original.cc: DropTail

red.cc: RED with custom parameters

🎯 Goal: Compare congestion behavior and throughput under different queuing strategies.
