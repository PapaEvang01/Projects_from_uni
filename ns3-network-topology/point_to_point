This project simulates a hybrid network using the NS-3 network simulator. 
It combines a point-to-point (P2P) link with a CSMA (Ethernet) LAN to model heterogeneous communication between nodes.

Topology:

A P2P link connects two nodes (n0 and n1)

One of them (n1) also connects to a LAN with 20+ other CSMA nodes

Traffic:

A UDP Echo Server runs on node n0

A UDP Echo Client runs on the last CSMA node (n21)

Purpose:

To observe UDP communication across different network segments

To capture traffic behavior and validate connectivity

ðŸ’¡ Key Settings:
P2P link: 14 Mbps / 10 ms delay

CSMA link: 10 Mbps / 25.6 Âµs delay

Client sends 10 packets of 1024 bytes at 1-second intervals
